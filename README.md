# CAKE UI Fundamental

## Who we are

- CAKE is a design system and frontend framework for the whole [SCHWARZ enterprise](https://jobs.schwarz/).
- We offer tools, guidelines and systems to develop faster products that match the CI.

Check out our project website under [cake.schwarz](https://cake.schwarz).

## What I am

- This is the fundamental library to our various UI Design kits for creating new products or websites for the SCHWARZ company.
- The CAKE UI Fundamental is a rudimentary symbol library with an own description of its use.

> The purpose of this readme file is to simply show the changes made to our old CAKE design system to our new one.

All used components meet the following requirements to find their way into our fundamental library:

  1. **The components donate our Corporate Design and generate digital awareness.**
  2. **The components can't be modified or changed in general – only in conjunction with a significant effort.**
  3. **The components have to be used obligatorily.**
  4. **Native elements on touch devices are an exception.**
